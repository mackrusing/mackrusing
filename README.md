# Hi, I'm Mack.

I'm an aspiring software developer living in Phoenix, Arizona.

## About

I took my first steps into web development in 2019, learning how websites are structured and styled with HTML and CSS. With the small ammount of knowledge I learned, I registered a domain and [created my first website](https://github.com/mackrusing/mackrusing.github.io/tree/e34465a56cfd279c10adcbb16e8fee9d203c9e87).

After that I dove into Python, and the basics of object-oriented programming. Since then Python has been my go-to language.

More recently I have been tinkering with the open-source keyboard firmware [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) and the web framework Flask.
